Spot On..Spontaneous..On the spot.. <br><br>



If this is the trail of thoughts you are on you've got it #SPOTON <br><br>



Close your eyes for a few seconds and let your thoughts travel down your memory lanes. You will realize that some of your most incredible pieces of poems and stories came to you spontaneously. After all only in spontaneity can we be who we truly are. <br>



Artists! What more are you waiting for? Join us at PH cafe Egmore on Sunday 11 Dec from 3 PM to 5 PM for an incredible evening of spontaneous poems and stories. By the way did we tell you who is going to come up with the prompts for you? We won't coz a little surprise is always good na ;) <br><br>



You can purchase your tickets from the link in our bio. <br><br>



We can't stay calm as our 8th collaboration in 'THE BIG NINE' series is with the amazing 'House of T'. Words can't do justice to the very special bond we share with them. This collaborative event is going to be FUN EXCITEMENT and CRAZINESS overloaded! <br>



/About House of T in their words: <br><br>



A platform that started in July 2018 with the aim to promote and help grassroot level artists to experiment and work on their art forms in a safe space. With an experience of hosting over 400+ events across 4 years and working with over 300+ artists we are constantly trying to find more platforms and spaces for artists to showcase and grow. <br><br>



Vaanga makkalae. Vaanga. Idhu vera level event ah irukapogudhu! <br><br>



<b>P.S </b>: Deleted Drafts is a non judgmental safe space for you to experiment your art. We are more than a platform. We are more than a community. We are and will always be one big art family.</p>
